            These Terms and Conditions (the "<b>Terms</b>") govern your use of our website located at www.roofstock.com (the "<b>Site</b>")
            and the online platform services provided by REITSimple, Inc. and REITSimple Realty LLC (collectively, "<b>REITSimple</b>")
            via our Site and our mobile device application ("<b>App</b>"). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, the App,
            and our services available via the Site and App are collectively called "<b>Services.</b>" Our online platform connects
            people who have real estate properties for sale ("<b>Seller(s)</b>") with people who are interested in buying real estate
            properties ("<b>Buyer(s)</b>"). You don't have to be a Buyer or Seller to use the Services - you can also use our Services
            to access and view our Content and Listings and other data and information made available to users of the Services.
            Buyers, Sellers and other users of the Services are collectively called "<b>Users</b>" in these Terms.&nbsp;

            <b>What We Do and Don't Do via the Services</b>
            <br /><br />
            <i>Technology Platform</i><br />
            REITSimple offers a technology service and platform via the Services through which Sellers and Buyers of real estate
            properties can connect. Sellers can sign up with the Services and advertise a list of real estate properties that
            are for sale by posting "<b>Listings.</b>" The real estate properties included in the Listings are collectively referred
            to as "<b>Homes,</b>" "<b>Roofs,</b>" or "<b>Properties</b>" or individually, a "<b>Home,</b>" a "<b>Roof</b>" or
            "<b>Property</b>" on the Services and in
            these Terms. Buyers can browse the Listings and contact the Seller's real estate agent or broker agent via the
            Services if they are interested in buying a Property included in a Listing. As described below,
            a REITSimple Entity may also act as the Seller's real estate agent or broker in connection with the sale of Property
            included in a Listing.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Acting as Seller's Real Estate Agent or Broker</i><br />
            REITSimple, through one of its licensed affiliates or subsidiaries ("<b>REITSimple Entity</b>") or a third party real estate
            agent or broker approved by REITSimple may also act as the Seller's real estate agent or broker in connection with
            the sale of a Property included in a Listing. If you are a Seller and wish to have a REITSimple Entity represent
            you as your real estate agent or broker, you agree to notify REITSimple in writing or via a communication method
            presented to you via the Services, and if the REITSimple Entity agrees to represent you, you will be required to
            enter into a real estate agency/broker representation and listing agreement ("<b>Listing Agreement</b>") with the applicable
            REITSimple Entity which will govern the terms of real estate agent/broker relationship between you and the REITSimple
            Entity. Although the Listing Agreement is an agreement between you as a Seller and a REITSimple Entity, the terms and
            conditions of the Listing Agreement are independent of, and in addition to, these Terms. In the event of any conflict
            or inconsistency between these Terms and the Listing Agreement with respect to a REITSimple Entity's role for sale of
            a Property, the Listing Agreement will govern.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Buyer's Real Estate Agent or Broker</i><br />
            While Buyers are not required to work with a real estate agent or broker to purchase a Property included in a Listing,
            a REITSimple Entity, as Seller’s agent, will work with a third party real estate agent or broker that represents a
            Buyer as the Buyer's real estate agent or broker in connection with the purchase of Property/ies included in Listings.
            In such cases, Buyers will enter into real estate agency/broker representation agreements ("<b>Broker Agreement(s)</b>")
            with the third party real estate agent or broker, which will govern the terms of real estate agent/broker
            relationship between you, as a Buyer, and your real estate agent and broker. Buyers are solely responsible for
            performing Buyers' obligations under any agreement that Buyers enter into with any real estate agents or brokers,
            including the payment of any commission or fee under such agreement. If a Buyer does not expressly submit Buyer's
            real estate agent's or broker's information to the Services, it is deemed that Buyer is not represented by a real
            estate agent or broker in connection with purchase of a Property.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Other Services</i><br />
            We may also provide analytics, valuation estimates, asset management and other information services to Users via the Services.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <b>Who May Use the Services</b><br />

            <br /><br />

            <b>Privacy Policy</b><br />
            REITSimple has a Privacy Policy which is located at https://www.roofstock.com/privacy; and is incorporated into the
            Terms by this reference. This policy includes information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our
            Users and your agreement to the Terms and use of the Services also constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the
            Privacy Policy.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <b>Seller Terms</b><br />
            The terms in this Section apply to you if you are a Seller. If you're a Buyer, please see the Section entitled
            "Buyer Terms" below.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>No Endorsement</i><br />
            We welcome you if you are a Seller, as long as you are posting a Listing that isn't illegal or unauthorized.
            However, we do not endorse any Sellers and your posting a Listing does not mean you or your Listing is endorsed
            in any way by us, even if REITSimple or a REITSimple Entity is acting as Seller's real estate agent or broker with
            respect to a particular Listing. We do not routinely conduct background checks on Sellers, but we reserve the
            right to do so on a discretionary basis, and you agree to cooperate with us and provide us with all information
            and execute any forms necessary that we request from you in the event that we decide to conduct a background
            check on you. We're not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your communications or interactions
            with Buyers or other Sellers, either via the Services or otherwise. Sellers are not employees, agents or otherwise
            contractors of REITSimple, but are independent people who want to post Listings and connect with Buyers.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            Except to the extent expressly set forth in a Listing Agreement with a REITSimple Entity, you agree that any legal
            remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of Buyer or other third parties regarding
            Listings or any Purchase and Sale Agreement (defined below) you enter into with a Buyer for purchase of a Property
            will be limited to a claim against the particular Buyer or other third parties, who caused you harm and you agree
            not to attempt to make a claim for damages or liability against REITSimple or a REITSimple Entity, or seek any legal
            remedy from REITSimple or a REITSimple Entity with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage
            you to communicate directly with your real estate agent or broker regarding Listings and Properties in which a
            Buyer has expressed interest and about which a Buyer has communicated with your real estate agent or broker via
            the Services. That said, you may also contact us and we will take any actions that we deem appropriate.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Your Obligations as a Seller</i>
            <br /><br />
            "<b>Listing(s)</b>" means a description of a Property that the Seller lists for sale using the Services. When one creates
            a Listing, you will need to submit information to us about the Property, including without limitation, images,
            general property information and tenant and lease information. You hereby grant a license to REITSimple to use
            such listing information in order to operate the Services - please see the Section below entitled "Rights in
            Content Granted by You". It is important that such information be complete and accurate and we do not verify
            any such information or User Content you provide to us via the Services for your Listings. A Listing can also
            include requirements with which potential Buyers must comply, in order to purchase the Property for sale in a Listing.
            We may provide Additional Property Information for Listings. You agree that you are responsible for all Listings you
            post and for keeping the Listings information current and up to date, including up to the date of sale of a Property
            included in a Listing. We reserve the right to reject a Listing for any reason in our sole and absolute discretion.
            We will notify you if we reject your Listing and we may give you an opportunity to amend your Listing into a form
            that we would publish.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            "<b>Additional Property Information</b>" means information about the Properties included in Listings, including, without
            limitation, valuation estimates, inspections, pest reports, conditions, repairs, cost estimates, financial estimates,
            neighborhood information, photographs, lease verification, property management terms, title, permits and lien information,
            that we obtain from a variety of sources. This Additional Property Information is licensed to Users under the Section
            below entitled "Rights in Content Granted by REITSimple" and our provision of the Additional Property Information to
            Users does not in any way mean that we have endorsed or are endorsing the Seller or Seller's Listing.
            You hereby authorize REITSimple to act on your behalf, if applicable, to gather the Additional Property Information
            and you agree to grant REITSimple any necessary authorization to do so. You acknowledge that the Additional
            Property Information made available via the Services is current as of the date that it was generated and
            REITSimple makes no warranties that the Additional Property Information will be accurate or up to date on that
            date that Users access and view the Additional Property Information.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Contract with Buyers</i><br />
            You acknowledge and agree that unless you, as a Seller, have entered into a separate Listing Agreement with a
            REITSimple Entity, in which case REITSimple's role, if any, will be addressed in the Listing Agreement, REITSimple does not,
            either directly, or indirectly, act as your real estate agent or broker, contracting agent or other representative.
            Regardless of whether or not you have entered into a Listing Agreement, if a Buyer wants to buy a Property included
            in your Listing, any contracts and/or Purchase and Sale Agreements that you enter into with the Buyer, written or oral,
            will be between you and the Buyer only. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not REITSimple, will be responsible
            for performing the obligations of any contracts with the Buyer, and REITSimple is not a party to such contracts or
            Purchase and Sale Agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to such contracts. You represent
            and warrant that you will act in compliance with all applicable laws in connection with Listings you post using the
            Services and any sale of Properties to Buyers.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <b>Buyer Terms</b><br />
            The terms in this Section apply to you if you are a Buyer. If you're a Seller, please see the Section "Seller Terms"
            above.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>No Endorsement and Buyer Diligence Review</i><br />
            We do not endorse any Seller or Seller's Listings. We don't have an obligation to conduct background checks on any
            Seller, but we might do so on a discretionary basis. Sellers are not employees, agents or otherwise contractors of
            REITSimple, but are independent people or entities who want to connect with Buyers. REITSimple is not responsible for
            any damage or harm resulting from your communication or interaction with Sellers or other Buyers. We may, on
            Seller's behalf, provide Additional Property Information to Buyers via the Services about a Seller's Listing.
            REITSimple makes no representation that the Additional Property Information provided is accurate or complete. With
            respect to a Property which the Buyer desires to purchase Buyer represents that Buyer has clicked on the "View
            Details" button for the Seller's Listing, clicked on the information icons&nbsp;<i className="fa fa-info-circle" style={{color: '#bcbec0'}} />
            and the "View Financials" associated with the financial information displayed on Seller's Listing and has reviewed
            the financial information displayed after the clicks. Buyer also understands that any such financial information
            displayed on the Site are only estimates and/or based upon third party information which has been obtained by
            REITSimple. Buyer further understands that any such financial information may not be accurate or complete and relies
            on such information at its own risk. Buyer has also clicked on the "View PDFs | Download" in the Diligence Vault
            and viewed the documents contained therein under each tab.

            <i>Disclaimers</i>

            (ii) SUCH ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
            AND INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES,
            FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, BUYER SHOULD RELY ON SUCH ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS AT ITS OWN RISK.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            Buyer understands and acknowledges
            (i) that investing in real estate is risky and unpredictable;
            (ii) that the real estate industry has its ups and downs; and
            (iii) that the Property you purchase might not be able to be rented at amounts sufficient to cover your debt,
            expenses and liabilities, and might not result in a positive cash flow. Buyer further understands and acknowledges
            that the value of any Property purchased may decline after you buy it and that future property values are
            unpredictable and may go down. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that REITSimple is not an investment or
            tax advisor and you must make your own investment and tax decisions either alone or with the assistance of
            professional investment and tax advisors.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Liability</i>
            <br /><br />
            You agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of Seller or other
            third parties regarding Listings or any Purchase and Sale Agreement you enter into with a Seller for purchase of a
            Property, will be limited to a claim against the particular Seller or other third parties who directly caused you
            harm and you agree not to attempt to make a claim for damages or liability against REITSimple or a REITSimple Entity,
            or seek any legal remedy from REITSimple or a REITSimple Entity with respect to such actions or omissions.
            For additional terms regarding liability, please also refer to the paragraphs hereinbelow entitled "Indemnity"
            and "Limitation of Liability".&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            We also encourage you to communicate directly with the Sellers regarding Listings they have posted for their Properties.
            You may also contact us and we will take any actions that we deem appropriate.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>Your Obligations as a Buyer</i>
            <br /><br />
            Contract with Sellers&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that we do not, either directly, or indirectly, act as your real estate
            agent or broker, contracting agent or other representative. Regardless of whether or not you have entered into a
            Broker Agreement, as a Buyer, you agree that the Seller will require you to enter into a contract and/or Purchase
            and Sale Agreement with the Seller in order to purchase a Property that the Seller has listed and you agree to
            accept any term, conditions, rules and restrictions imposed by the Seller. You acknowledge and agree that you,
            and not REITSimple, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any contracts with the Seller,
            and that REITSimple is not a party to such contracts or Purchase and Sale Agreements and disclaims all liability
            arising from or related to such contracts.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            Financial Terms between REITSimple and Buyers&nbsp;At the time you decide to purchase a Property included in a Listing,
            you agree to pay REITSimple a non-refundable marketplace fee ("<b>Marketplace Fee</b>") as described in terms,
            which we will make available prior to you entering into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Seller for a Property.
            After REITSimple has successfully processed your payment of the Marketplace Fee, REITSimple will remove the Listing
            for the applicable Property from the marketplace in the Services so that other Users will not be able to purchase
            that Property. REITSimple Realty LLC will also send you an agreement that governs the sale of the property for you
            to execute ("<b>Purchase and Sale Agreement</b>") within 24 hours after the payment of Marketplace Fee. If you do not
            execute the Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Seller within 24 hours after receiving the Purchase and Sale
            Agreement (which may be waived in by the Seller), REITSimple will reinstate the Listing for the applicable
            Property to the marketplace in the Services so that other Users will be able to view and purchase the Property.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            Any Marketplace Fee paid by you is final and non-refundable, unless the Seller is unable to fulfill Seller's obligations
            under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. If the Seller is unable to meet the required obligations under the
            Purchase and Sale Agreement and other obligations required by applicable law, the Marketplace Fee will be
            refunded to your account.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <b>Property Managers</b>
            <br /><br />
            REITSimple may from time to time recommend, feature, certify or refer you to certain third-party property managers
            or management companies ("Featured Property Manager") for the management of the Property you purchase.
            You are free to use or engage such property managers in your sole discretion and any decision to do so
            shall be at your own risk. REITSimple does not warrant or guarantee the performance or services provided
            by your property managers and you shall look solely to your property managers for recourse in the event of
            any failure to perform or damages caused by such property managers.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            To the extent you decide to engage a Featured Property Manager, you hereby consent and authorize your property
            manager to provide REITSimple with all reports and information requests relating to your Property, including
            monthly financial information and portfolio level data, for the purpose of allowing REITSimple to evaluate asset
            performance for Properties purchased via the REITSimple platform and to use such data and combine it with other
            data in aggregate form maintained or used by REITSimple.&nbsp;

            <b>The REITSimple Guarantee</b>
            <br /><br />
            <b>THE “ROOFSTOCK GUARANTEE” DESCRIBED DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY PROPERTY THAT IS LABELED AS A “ROOFSTOCK RACK” OR
              OTHER SIMILAR TERM OR THAT IS NOTED AS NOT BEING FULLY CERTIFIED.</b>
            <br /><br />
            Other than as set forth above, REITSimple provides a 30-day guarantee to Buyers of a certified Property purchased
            under a REITSimple Realty LLC Sale and Purchase Agreement via the Services. This guarantee applies if you, as a Buyer,
            are not satisfied with a certified Property purchased from a Seller via our Services and you notify REITSimple in
            writing of your dissatisfaction within 30 days of the closing of the sale of such certified Property and the
            following conditions are met:&nbsp;
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>There must be no material change to the condition of the certified Property since the closing of the sale of the certified Property;
              </li>
              <li>There must have been no Material Adverse Changes with respect to the certified Property;
              </li>
              <li>REITSimple must be provided the right to re-market and re-sell the certified Property for you for 90 days from
                the date REITSimple receives your notice of the dissatisfaction ("90 Day Resale Period"); and
              </li>
              <li>During the 90 day Resale Period you must maintain the certified Property in good working order and condition
                and pay the Property expenses as they become due.
              </li>
            </ul>
            If you meet the foregoing conditions, at the end of the 90 Day Resale Period, you will be paid an amount equal to
            your Investment Price if REITSimple is able to resell the certified Property at the Investment Price, or if resold
            by REITSimple below the Investment Price, you will be paid the amount for which the certified Property is resold
            plus the difference between the Investment Price and the resale price. If the certified Property is sold for an
            amount greater than the Investment Price, REITSimple will be entitled to keep the amount in excess of the Investment
            Price.  If the certified Property is not resold within the 90 Day Resale Period, then REITSimple at its sole election
            will purchase from you and take title to the certified Property for the Investment Price, or will pay you the amount
            of the Property’s Investment Price without taking title. Only one certified Property per Buyer is covered under this
            guarantee and only one guarantee claim may be made by any Buyer during any ninety (90) day period.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            For the purposes of the REITSimple guarantee, the "Buyer" includes a person or entity who signed the Purchase and
            Sale Agreement for the certified Property or the person or entity named on the title to the certified Property
            by the original Buyer immediately after the closing of the purchase of the Property.
            <br /><br />
            For the purposes of the REITSimple guarantee, the term "Investment Price" means the purchase price of the Property
            under Buyer's Purchase and Sale Agreement.
            <br /><br />
            A "Material Adverse Change" means with respect to a Property, any change, event, circumstance, development or effect
            (each a "Change") that individually or taken together with all other Changes, is reasonably likely to be, or
            become materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), assets or liabilities of the Property,
            which Change may also include acts of god or terrorists, or general economic or business conditions impacting
            the real estate industry where the Property is located.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />

            <br /><br />
            <b>Arbitration of Disputes</b>
            <br /><br />
            YOU AND ROOFSTOCK AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE
            BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR
            CONTENT (COLLECTIVELY, "<b>DISPUTES</b>") WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU AND ROOFSTOCK RETAIN THE RIGHT:
            (I) TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT; AND
            (II) TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR

            PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING CLAUSE (II),(AN "<b>IP PROTECTION ACTION</b>").

            <b>Arbitration Opt Out</b>
            <br /><br />
            WITHOUT LIMITING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT AND LITIGATE ANY OTHER DISPUTE IF
            YOU PROVIDE ROOFSTOCK WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DESIRE TO DO SO BY EMAIL OR REGULAR MAIL AT CONTACT@ROOFSTOCK.COM
            WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THESE TERMS (SUCH NOTICE, AN "<b>ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE</b>").
            IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE ROOFSTOCK WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE WITHIN THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD, YOU WILL BE
            DEEMED TO HAVE KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH

            DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN SUCH COURTS.
            UNLESS YOU TIMELY PROVIDE ROOFSTOCK WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE,&nbsp;<b>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND
              ROOFSTOCK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</b>&nbsp; IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE,
            THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION WILL BE DEEMED VOID. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE PRECEDING
            SENTENCE, THIS "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <br />
            <i>ARBITRATION RULES</i><br />
            THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
            COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "AAA RULES")
            THEN IN EFFECT, EXCEPT AS MODIFIED BY THIS "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION. (THE AAA RULES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
            AT WWW.ADR.ORG/ARB_MED OR BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1-800-778-7879.) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WILL GOVERN THE
            INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS SECTION.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>ARBITRATION PROCESS</i><br />
            A PARTY WHO DESIRES TO INITIATE ARBITRATION MUST PROVIDE THE OTHER PARTY WITH A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AS
            SPECIFIED IN THE AAA RULES. (THE AAA PROVIDES A GENERAL DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AND A SEPARATE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION
            FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.) THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE EITHER A RETIRED JUDGE OR AN ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE
            LAW AND WILL BE SELECTED BY THE PARTIES FROM THE AAA'S ROSTER OF ARBITRATORS. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO
            AGREE UPON AN ARBITRATOR WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF DELIVERY OF THE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION, THEN EITHER PARTY MAY
            REQUEST THAT THE AAA APPOINT THE ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AAA RULES.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE</i><br />
            UNLESS YOU AND ROOFSTOCK OTHERWISE AGREE, THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE COUNTY OR STATE WHERE YOU RESIDE.
            IF YOUR CLAIM DOES NOT EXCEED $10,000, THEN THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE DOCUMENTS
            THAT YOU AND ROOFSTOCK SUBMIT TO THE ARBITRATOR; UNLESS YOU REQUEST A HEARING OR THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT
            A HEARING IS NECESSARY. IF YOUR CLAIM EXCEEDS $10,000, YOUR RIGHT TO A HEARING WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE AAA RULES.
            SUBJECT TO THE AAA RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO DIRECT A REASONABLE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
            BY THE PARTIES, CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPEDITED NATURE OF THE ARBITRATION.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>ARBITRATOR'S DECISION</i><br />
            THE ARBITRATOR WILL RENDER A FINAL AND BINDING AWARD WITHIN THE TIME FRAME SPECIFIED IN THE AAA RULES.
            THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL INCLUDE THE ESSENTIAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS UPON WHICH THE ARBITRATOR
            BASED THE AWARD. JUDGMENT ON THE ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.
            THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD OF DAMAGES MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THE "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY" PROVISIONS
            ABOVE AS TO THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES FOR WHICH A PARTY MAY BE HELD LIABLE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
            DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
            RELIEF WARRANTED BY THE CLAIMANT'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF YOU ARE THE PREVAILING PARTY OR THE MORE PREVAILING
            PARTY IN ARBITRATION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED
            UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. ROOFSTOCK WILL NOT SEEK, AND HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO
            RECOVER, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, IF IT PREVAILS IN ARBITRATION.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>FEES</i><br />
            YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY ANY AAA FILING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES WILL BE SOLELY AS SET FORTH IN THE AAA
            RULES.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <i>CHANGES</i><br />
            NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE "CHANGES TO TERMS OR SERVICES" SECTION ABOVE, IF ROOFSTOCK MATERIALLY CHANGES
            THIS "ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES" SECTION AFTER THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THESE TERMS (OR ACCEPTED ANY SUBSEQUENT
            CHANGES TO THESE TERMS), YOU MAY REJECT ANY SUCH CHANGE BY SENDING US WRITTEN NOTICE (INCLUDING BY EMAIL
            TO CONTACT@ROOFSTOCK.COM) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE SUCH CHANGE BECAME EFFECTIVE, AS INDICATED IN THE
            "LAST UPDATED" DATE NOTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DOCUMENT OR IN THE DATE OF ROOFSTOCK'S EMAIL TO YOU
            NOTIFYING YOU OF SUCH CHANGE. BY REJECTING ANY CHANGE, YOU ARE AGREEING THAT YOU WILL ARBITRATE ANY
            DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ROOFSTOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION
            AS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THESE TERMS (OR ACCEPTED ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THESE TERMS).&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <b>General Terms</b><br />
            These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between REITSimple and you regarding
            the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements
            between REITSimple and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable
            (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the "Arbitration" section above or by court of
            competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out
            Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
            permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign
            or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without REITSimple's prior written consent.
            Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void.
            REITSimple may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing,
            these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            Any notices or other communications provided by REITSimple under these Terms, including those regarding
            modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services.
            For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            REITSimple's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such
            right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed
            by a duly authorized representative of REITSimple. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise
            by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
            under these Terms or otherwise.&nbsp;
